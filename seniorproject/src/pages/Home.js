This is especially problematic for young participants, participants in states without legalized sports betting, and those who struggle with gambling addiction.

                <p>
                  The developer of <strong><strong>HuddleHero</strong></strong>, Nathan Campbell, has been playing fantasy football since 2015. He is an active participant in a handful of leagues each year, running several himself or as a co-commissioner. He has experience using several different fantasy football platforms, such as NFL.com, ESPN, and Sleeper. As an experienced league owner, he knows what kinds of features users wish to use in their fantasy football leagues.
                </p>

                <h4>Why Nathan created HuddleHero:</h4>
                <p>
                  "In my nine years of experience playing fantasy football, I‚Äôve participated in and hosted dozens of leagues each season. I‚Äôve explored various platforms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some lacked robust setting customization, making it difficult to tailor the game to my preferences. Others had interfaces that were challenging to navigate, leading to confusion and frustration. Many had elusive chat systems, forcing us to resort to external communication methods like email or text messages‚Äîwhich interrupts the flow of the game.
                  I have also noticed the increasing implementation of sports betting content into fantasy football platforms, which can lead to a distracting or hostile experience for users who do not subscribe to sports betting. The largest shortcoming, however, is the lack of a beginner-friendly experience. This issue became apparent to me shortly after coming to College of the Ozarks when I created a fantasy football league to compete with my friends. Because some of my friends were novices to fantasy football, they often had to ask questions and receive assistance that took away from the quality of everyone‚Äôs experience. <strong>HuddleHero</strong> is the solution to those shortcomings."
