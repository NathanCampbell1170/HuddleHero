          <strong>What Is the Draft?</strong>
          <p>
            The draft is the heart and soul of fantasy football. It's where you assemble your team by selecting real NFL players to fill your roster. Think of it as your chance to play general manager‚Äîmaking strategic decisions that can lead you to victory.

          <strong>How Does the Draft Work?</strong>
          <p>
            <strong>Draft Order:</strong> Before the draft begins, the league commissioner randomly determines the draft order. Each team's position in the order is assigned without any manual intervention. This randomized order ensures fairness and unpredictability.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Snake Draft Format:</strong> Most leagues use a snake draft format. Here's how it works:
            <ul>
              <li>Round 1: Teams pick in order (e.g., Team A, Team B, Team C).</li>
              <li>Round 2: The order reverses (e.g., Team C, Team B, Team A).</li>
              <li>And so on, alternating each round.</li>
            </ul>
            The snake format ensures that every team has an equal opportunity to select top players.
          </p>

          <strong>Drafting Players:</strong>
          <p>
            When it's your turn, you select a player from the available pool. Consider player rankings, positions, bye weeks, and injury history. Strategize based on your team needs. Do you grab a star running back (RB) early or focus on a top wide receiver (WR)?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Positional Depth:</strong>
          <p>
            Understand positional depth. Some positions (like RB) have fewer elite players, so securing them early is crucial. Others (like WR) may offer more depth, allowing you to wait. Flexibility is key‚Äîadapt your strategy as the draft unfolds.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Embrace the Excitement:</strong>
          <p>
            The draft is where champions are built. It's a thrilling experience‚Äîanticipating each pick, analyzing stats, and making split-second decisions. Enjoy the adrenaline rush and the camaraderie with fellow managers!
          </p>
